#### Hej hej!


Most of the repos you find here are either forks (as backup) or stubs (for past and future ideas);
the projects that might have some meaningful original content are the pinned ones, so feel to free to check those out in earnest!

You may have a look at [my blog](https://blog.vyo.sh) and the [code powering it](https://github.com/vyo/blog) but beware - updates are intermittent and content is mercurial 0=)

Anywho, if you want to get in touch about anything relating to DX, UX and languages in general, give it a go!


#### Cheers, manu <3
